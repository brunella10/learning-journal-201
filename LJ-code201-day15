# **Learning Journal 17**

## __***week 4***__

 - Started algorithm. We did not finish the algorithm.
	 - Even when I found a couple of possible solutions. It was not viable to be applied to our project. As its was using API's and jQuery.
 - Finished the Pseudo Code. We did finish pseudo code
 - Define the image positioning. Zack finished this.
	 - After that we found that we need to make the empty tile a fixed position in our puzzle. So, I came with the idea to drop it off from the array function and it work!.
 - Make structure for the functions. We made a randomize function.
 - I white boarding during the day.
 - I came with new approach for the game. As we did not find a way to finish our plan for the day. At the afternoon we agree to change to plan B.

> **Note:**
The new game is going to be base in a randomize image and the user should select an previously assign image and click on it every time the image appear on the screen in order to increase the score. We gonna use a score table display instead of a list of "image most clicked". We gonna save the score at the local storage in order to be able to show a message like "You beat your last score". It can be modify to help kids to learn colors and numbers.
