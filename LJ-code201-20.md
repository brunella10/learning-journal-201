# **Learning Journal 20**

## __***week 4***__

 The day has come! Finally we were able to finish our app on time even the previous issue we had during the two first weeks. 
 The team was amazing, Kate is super organized and focused! 
 In general we work perfect together.  Each of us have knowledge that help the team work smoothless. 
 During the morning of the presentation we made change and when we merged it and we create a disaster! hahaha but, again, we fix it!
 It was fun work with this guys during the week.

> **Note:** I will try to finish the first project at home during my month of break.
