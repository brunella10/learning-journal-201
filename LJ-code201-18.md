# **Learning Journal 18**

## __***week 4***__

 - Plan B is working.  
 - The team was working on functionality.
 - I was working on the timer to display a countdown clock for the user and I had a really bad day. I spend all day figuring out and the multiple options it was not working as we wanted.
 - All the team was reallllyyyy patient with me yesterday!

> **Note:**
We had a BIIIGGGG conflic on our github. As all of us were working on the project during the night and we did not know it, by the time we tried to make pull from master all the disaster came out. Thanks Hawa was around and help us to solve.
