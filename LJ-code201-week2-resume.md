# **ADA application essay**

## ***Gabriela Diez Rivas***

**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**
I like being creative and being able to see the results of my work. When I went through the 101 course back in november, it was kind of frustrating to try and try and refresh and refresh the page without getting results. That constant frustrating feeling made me keep pushing until I saw what I was expecting to be displayed on my screen. I like coding because is challenging and often puts me in a situation to wonder what’s next or if there’s another way to solve it. To code, you need get together not just your knowledge, but also have a vision to create code that could be easy to read and understand for others and that works with other’s code. 
Developing code is like building a puzzle. All the pieces have to fit if you want to see the image like it’s supposed to look. Although sometimes the code looks like it could fit, it’s not always the real piece, so you have to be aware of the choice you make that you think is going to be the perfect piece. 
To me, writing code is entertaining and makes the time fly by. After all what I like the most is watch my result after a couple of hours struggling with the all options.

**2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?**
I hope to have the courage to be able to know enough to feel comfortable teaching someone on my charge. For me, in the short time that I have coding, I can tell how hard it is to feel confidence on what you are doing. But, in 5 year, I'm sure that feeling will be gone. I would like to be able to create something by myself and encourage other to follow their own path. 

**3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?** 
I’m from a small town in Venezuela named Coro in the Falcon State   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coro,_Venezuela). It is a place where everybody knows each other and where your childhood friends are sons and daughters of your parents’ childhood friends. Since I was a teenager, I knew my city was too small for me. In 2002, I was accepted at the Law school in a University away from my home, at the 3rd biggest city in Venezuela (Maracaibo). I’ve spent almost the same amount of time that I’ve lived with my family, living away from them. I left my home being 17 years old and since then, I have came back to live with them. When I finished my degree I knew what the next step would be, I left the country in 2008. I moved to Spain to get a Masters degree in Fiscal Law. I officially became an immigrant. The first years in Spain I was alone. Fortunately, by the end of 2009, my now husband moved there as well. 
I have almost been 10 years living in many places where I have felt happy but incomplete because of the difficulty that job searching represents in foreign cultures. I have been working the majority of time in the past, in customer service and executive assistant positions, but never as a Lawyer, which is kind of frustrating. I have not being independent financially because of that, and that is something that makes me keep going, it would be my goal at the end of the program. I feel the need to be able to produce and contribute to our home expenses. At the moment, I’m working as sales associate at ZARA, a retail store in downtown and taking English classes at Seattle Central College. I have a mantra that I always apply to myself: “No matter what needs to be done, do it in the best you can”. I have always given 100% in everything that I’ve started. It is the only way that you can expect your situation to get better. 
To me, having been part of minority, having been an immigrant and a woman during the past 9 years, has represented the need to demonstrate everyone that they are wrong when they say “You can’t do it.” It is a continuous struggle that you always have to face as an immigrant. But this is not a bad thing for me, is the opposite, is a new opportunity to challenge mysef to see what I am able to accomplish.
As a person, I see myself as a friendly, talkative and creative woman. All those years that I’ve been living in differents countries (Spain, Mexico, USA), have taught me to be open to new ideas, accept people the way they are, even when I don’t agree with them. 

**4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**
I always have been an independent person. By the time that I was applying to the University, my family was talking about that they wouldn't let me go to study the carreer that I want to study because I was too young, 17 years by that time. I took my decision, I knew what I want... so I paid the fee for the application (a sort of exam for them to know if I fitted to their requirement) with my own money (I used to be babysitter to my cousin). When the time came, just my aunt knew what it was happen. I took a public transport to other city and I did the admision test. Long history short, I got admited and I created a conflict at home, because my mom trusted in me and my father won't. I did not had the support of my father and I always have regret that I wasn't able to convince him to trusted in me. If I would do it again, maybe I would try to convince him to give me his support, instead of try to do everything behind his back or by my own.
