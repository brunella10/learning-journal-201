## DOM 
Define a problem and identify the step that are involved. detailed the solutions it could be the second steps. what the component are. (*ryan sobol $160 hour rate). 
html every element is an object that can be manipulable. The DOM as 
we can access to html from js file using command as document.body or document.head.’someproperties’ (can access to the properties inside the html element you tag)

## Constructor

 -  create the element 
 -  give the element some content 
 -  append  the element to the appropriate place in the DOM.
 ## I learned
 
 - Implement a constructor function.  
 - Replace the list with a single table. 
 - Add a total column. (The third requirement is not mandatory.)

##Code Structure
 
Top of the code → Set up data
	→ Declare global variable
	→ DOM element
	→ Constructor (s)
		Data first = properties
		Functions = methods
	→ Create instances
Define behavior → 
	→ functions 
		→ Set up local variables
		→ Define function logic
Executable Code → what really run when you go to the browser.
	→ Function calls
	→ Event listeners
 
Events: 
 handle user input and all kind of user behavior. Interaction user - page. 

##Check event listener
 
element. addEventListener(‘event’, ‘function name’, [boolean]);
function inside function, function calling functions…
‘blur’ event: trigger to the callback function
call back function: 
event flow: super important but not now for us. 
Event Object: store a lot of data after an event occur.
target: 
Prevent default event: cancel default behavior of an event. Page 265.

> **Note:**
I still having issues figuring out how to put together the code. I have some issues figuring out what should I do with my code.
